      <h3 class="toDoHeadings">La Noria</h3>
      <p class="toDoContent">
        Set away from the city center in the neighborhood of the same name, La Noria is certainly worth the extra cab
        fare. It’s a bit of a Puebla institution and a perennial local favorite, and it’s not hard to see why. Part of
        its appeal is a lush, leafy garden where you dine surrounded by tropical flora – a genuinely romantic spot by
        night. Food-wise, it’s a rich melange of local flavors, elegantly presented with a flourish. La Noria welcomes
        all ages. PRICE RANGE. $25 - $35
